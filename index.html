    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Video games have always been a significant passion of mine, growing up as both a source of entertainment and inspiration. 
      <br>To channel this enthusiasm, I am currently learning game development using the Godot Engine as part of a personal passion project.</br> 
      This journey allows me to dive into both programming and design, giving me hands-on experience in creating interactive experiences while exploring the creative and technical challenges of game development.</p>
    <p>In addition, I am actively studying web development through self-paced courses on freeCodeCamp, focusing on HTML and CSS. </br>
      As part of this learning experience, I am applying my newly acquired skills by designing and building this portfolio website.
      It serves as a practical project to showcase my knowledge, refine my understanding of web technologies, and develop a better grasp of creating responsive and visually engaging designs.
